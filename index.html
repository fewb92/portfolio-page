            <h2>Joshua Soto</h2><h3>Operations Manager, Photographer, Crypto Trader</h3> 
            
            <p>Joshua Soto is a New York City born, Bronx raised Latino who attended Baruch College. Throughout his career he has worked in a number of projects and roles which have earned him experience in logistics, finance/accounting, sales, client relations and more. In his previous role he served as Operations & Accounts Manager for a Berlin based fashion textile company beginning to emerge in the US market. In just under two years Joshua helped generate roughly $3M in revenue while servicing distributors, large key accounts, and all wholesale and end-consumer business in North & South America. Joshua joined Hopeland as Operations Manager to enrich and help the lives of those in need. The faces of children he's never met who wish and hope for a better life are the faces that motivate him every day to build a better future for children without families.
            Joshua plans to give back to the Bronx community one day, when he is capable.</p>
